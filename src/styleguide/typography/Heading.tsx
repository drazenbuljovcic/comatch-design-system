                Text is used all over the place as it is the main way to digest content and accomplish your work. This
                leaves us with providing texts that are hierarchial and easily readable and convey the info needed at
                one glance. We work with the font family ATC Overlook and fall back to Helvetica if needed. To convey
                the information in our interfaces we use two different weights in upper + lower case.
