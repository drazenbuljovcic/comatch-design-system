                We always stay on a professional level yet we want our customers to feel like we are approachable and a
                partner on an eye-to-eye-level, without coming across as waiting on their hand and foot. We must keep a
                necessary politeness and an initial level of formality with senior clients. Ultimately we want to focus
                more on the what it is they need and less on the how we communicate.
